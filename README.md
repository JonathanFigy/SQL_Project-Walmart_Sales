## Key Findings 
### Fashion Accessories is the Top-Performing Product Line by Volume
Fashion Accessories recorded the highest number of units sold (178 total sales), outperforming all other product lines. In contrast, Health & Beauty had the lowest sales volume (152 units), indicating weaker demand relative to other categories.

### Food and Beverages Drives the Highest Revenue Across Stores
The Food and Beverages product line generated the highest total revenue ($56,145), making it the most financially impactful category. Conversely, Health & Beauty recorded the lowest revenue ($49,194), aligning with its lower sales volume and indicating potential pricing or demand challenges.

### Clear Gender-Based Product Preferences Exist
Sales analysis by gender revealed that female customers predominantly purchased Fashion Accessories, while male customers showed a stronger preference for Health & Beauty products. These patterns suggest opportunities for gender-targeted marketing, personalized promotions, and optimized product placement.

## Business Recommendations
### Double Down on High-Performing Product Lines
Increase inventory allocation, shelf visibility, and promotional focus for Fashion Accessories, as it leads in sales volume, and Food and Beverages, which generates the highest revenue. These categories are clear drivers of both traffic and profitability.

### Re-evaluate Health & Beauty Strategy
Given that Health & Beauty records both the lowest sales volume and lowest revenue, conduct a deeper review of pricing, product assortment, and in-store placement. Consider targeted discounts, bundling strategies, or replacing underperforming SKUs to improve performance.

### Leverage Gender-Based Purchasing Behavior
Implement gender-targeted marketing campaigns, such as promoting Fashion Accessories to female customers and Health & Beauty products to male customers. Personalized offers and optimized product placement can increase conversion rates and basket size.

### Optimize Staffing Based on Time-of-Day Sales Patterns
Allocate more staff during afternoon peak hours, when sales volume and customer ratings are highest. This can improve checkout efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall store performance.
