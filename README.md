### Food and Beverages Drives the Highest Revenue Across Stores
The Food and Beverages product line generated the highest total revenue ($56,145), making it the most financially impactful category. Conversely, Health & Beauty recorded the lowest revenue ($49,194), aligning with its lower sales volume and indicating potential pricing or demand challenges.
